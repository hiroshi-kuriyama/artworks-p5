This artwork utilizes facial detection through an integrated camera system to detect the position of the viewer's face and aligns it with the detected location of the pupils. As a result, the gaze of the artwork follows the movement of the viewer's face, creating an interactive experience.

The viewers not only observe the artwork but are also observed by it, establishing a reciprocal visual connection.
